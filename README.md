# FiberCoin (still in construction)
Fibercoin uses an active blockchain that does not keep track of all previous transactions, but rather stores a hash for the previous transactions maintaining privacy and significantly reduces blockchain file size.
Fibercoin uses true peer discovery with no centralized network of any sort in place.
Fibercoin's mining algorithm benifits from delay between nodes, rather that processing power.
